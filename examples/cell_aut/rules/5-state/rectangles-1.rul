% Random initial state quickly decays into a set of motionless areas
% of constant state. different states have different sizes, state-2 area
% being the largest, usually making a connected set and "containing" others.
% Interestingly, areas of state 4 are rectangular, with 1-pixel width
% borders of state 3.
